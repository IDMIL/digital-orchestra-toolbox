# DOT - Digital Orchestra Toolbox

This "toolbox" is a collection of Max abstractions that we have found useful in creating gesture processing patches for digital musical instruments. Each patch is accompanied by a help patch to demonstrate its use.

Since the tools are provided as Max abstractions rather than external objects, there should be no issues with cross-platform use. Additionally, anyone can open the abstraction patches to see how it functions.
